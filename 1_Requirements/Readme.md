# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM
A wiper speed control system for an automobile wiper regulates the operating speed of a wiper in accordance with the amount of rain falling on the windshield. This is a very much essential component in each automobile as it avoids the risk of accidents during rainy conditions.

# WORKING PROCESS
* The RED LED is considered for the ACC position. Once the push button is pressed for 2 seconds, the RED LED keeps continuously glowing until the stop of the engine signifying the engine condition to be turned ON.
* On press of the user input push button, the other three Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency. The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz.
* The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts with the next press.
* If the push button is pressed for 2 seconds continuously, the RED light goes off and the pattern stops bringing it to default position which signifies the engine is turned OFF.

# SWOT ANALYSIS
## Strength

* The wiper comes back to default position even if stooped in the middle
* Safety for the driver as well as the passengers in the vehicle
* Clear Visibility to the Driver for neat ride.

## Weakness 
* The total cost of the wiper system is high if implemented in real-time.
* The major disadvantage is that STM32 contains only one button for all the operation
* User has to undergo a sequence to acquire desired result and can't attain his result directly with the press of the button.

## Opportunities
* Rain sensing and automatic operation can be implemented as further enhancement.

## Threats 
* Replacing the board is not possible if it malfunctions.
* Can't have more functions as the functionality of the board is very basic.

# 5WS AND 1H
## WHAT
It is Wiper Control system which is generally deployed in all the automobiles in order to ensure safety for the passengers and drivers during rainy conditions.

## WHERE
It is an element which is present in the windshield of the automobile.

## WHO
It is highly useful for drivers of any kind of automobile who needs clear vision of the road in case of dust or rain.

## WHEN
It is recommended to operate during dust or rain

## WHY
To get a clear vision of the road.

## HOW
It is implemented with the help of STM32 with the desired operation of turning on the engine, changing of speeds and turning off with the help of Embedded c Programming.
